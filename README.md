# Corona Widget SDK

The Corona Widget SDK is a collection of common and useful libraries and assets that can be used to build widgets.  Clone this repository to your system and point the _corona-api_ `--static-root` path at the checked-out path (_corona-api_ uses a default path of `/usr/share/sprinkles/assets`).  This will make the contents of this repository available to your widgets through the API endpoint `/static`.

## Quickstart

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/corona
sudo git clone https://github.com/auroralaboratories/corona-widget-sdk.git /usr/share/corona/assets
```
